- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lexgend13
- 👀 I’m interested in ... the purpose and meaning of life and consciousness.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... my morning routine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate ... no, not really. Dont want to be a traitor to my own country
- 📫 How to reach me ... preferably by telegram on NL 6942. You can try smoke signals, but I might forget to respond.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... as an AI language model, I cant fill in for you how you want to be referred to.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... "eleven plus two" and "twelve plus one" are anagrams. As numerical equations, they equal the same number, 13, which is also the amount of letters of the anagram.

Hope this helps!
